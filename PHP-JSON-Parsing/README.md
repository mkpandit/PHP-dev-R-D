# Execute a Python Script from PHP - Read and parse a JSON file

In this example, I tried to demonstrate how to execute a Python script from PHP. Once the Python script is executed, it generate output, PHP also captures those output and process for next use.

This example also covers reading and parsing a JSON file.
